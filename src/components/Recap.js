    <p>
        
Week 5 in the books. Fajt and Det seperate themselves from the pack, with everyone besides Brandon still very much in the hunt. ESPN gives nasty a generous 4% chance of playoffs,
        although my model has him even lower. We may need to implement a last place punishment starting next year, to keep the Brandons of the world from mailing it in and giving his weekly matchup a free square for the rest of the season.
        I'm not convinced Fajt didnt auto draft while at hockey, but that Chase/Kupp duo is looking 
        deadly. Wilding slides down my power rankings due to horrendous luck. Burrow finally shows some promise, giving hope to Tee Higgins, only to 
        lose Justin Jefferson and James "volume king" Conner in the same day. G-reg didnt seem to mind, though. Good luck to everyone except Det this week!

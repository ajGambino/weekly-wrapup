    <p>Four weeks into the season and we have half the league 
        tied for first place. Brian is one game back while the 
        rest of us start in the basement. Lot of season left, although
         you wouldnt know it the way Brandon has already thrown in the towel.  ESPN's awful projections have Deez as the early frontrunner, with Det and Cleve rounding out the top 3. Check out my data model at the bottom of this page to see my own projections. One thing ESPN and I can agree on, is Brandons single digit probability to make the playoffs. 
        Not surprising, is that Det leads the league in 
        moves made (12), while Greg and Wildman seemingly 
        like their draft capital with only one move each so far.
        Good Luck to everyone except Jer this week!

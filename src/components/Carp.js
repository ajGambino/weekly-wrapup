    <h2>Carp's Crown</h2>
    <p>For this week's Queen, we crown Craig and his "could have been" win vs Wilding. He slides to 1-3 after being forced to play the jets DST and crying about not being able to drop Danny Dimes for the Chargers. The 12pt difference at defense would have been enough to propel him 3.92pts ahead for the W. Better luck next week, Carp. </p>

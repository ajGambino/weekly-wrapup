    <h2>Carp's Crown</h2>
    <p> I'm crowning Josh Mcdaniels this week, for attempting a 52yd FG instead of going for it on 4th and 2 at the 34 on MNF. 
        To be fair I thought the decision was much worse than it was in real time. Why are teams paying for full teams of statistical analysts
         if the coach isn't going 
        to listen to them? You give yourself a better chance to win 
        the game by PUNTING than kicking the FG, but by a clear margin the most +EV play here is to obviously go for it. 

        Win % is 3% higher if you fail to convert vs fail the FG, and 8% higher if you succeed the 4th down vs make the FG. These may seem like
        small edges, but this is the NFL and the difference in these decisions is inexcusable when you are coaching at the highest level. Sadly, none of it mattered despite missing the kick because math is dumb. Where's the justice?  </p>
